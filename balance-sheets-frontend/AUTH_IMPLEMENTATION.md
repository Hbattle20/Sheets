# Authentication Implementation Summary

## Overview
Email/password authentication has been implemented using Supabase Auth. Users can play anonymously or create an account to save their progress.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Security (RLS Policies)
- Created `setup_rls_policies.sql` in the backend folder
- Enables Row Level Security on `user_matches`, `chat_sessions`, and `chat_messages`
- Users can only access their own data

### 2. Authentication Components
- **AuthContext** (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`) - Manages auth state globally
- **SignUpForm** - Email/password registration with validation
- **SignInForm** - Login with error handling
- **PasswordReset** - Request and reset password functionality
- **AuthModal** - Modal wrapper for auth forms

### 3. UI Updates
- **Navigation** - Shows sign in/up buttons or user email with sign out
- Auth modal opens when clicking sign in/sign up buttons
- Smooth transitions between auth forms

### 4. Game Integration
- **Match Saving** - Authenticated users' guesses are saved to the database
- **Chat Sessions** - Chat history is persisted for logged-in users
- Anonymous users still use localStorage

### 5. Auth Flow Pages
- `/auth/callback` - Handles email confirmation redirects
- `/auth/reset-password` - Password reset form

## How to Test

1. **Apply RLS Policies** - Run the SQL in `setup_rls_policies.sql` in Supabase dashboard

2. **Test Sign Up**:
   - Click "Sign up" in navigation
   - Enter email and password
   - Check email for confirmation (limited to 2/hour on free tier)
   - Click confirmation link

3. **Test Sign In**:
   - Click "Sign in" 
   - Use confirmed email/password
   - Should see email in navigation

4. **Test Game Features**:
   - Play game while signed in
   - Guesses are saved to database
   - Chat messages persist across sessions

5. **Test Password Reset**:
   - Click "Forgot password?" on sign in form
   - Enter email
   - Check email for reset link

## Environment Variables Required
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Next Steps
1. Configure custom SMTP for production (current limit: 2 emails/hour)
2. Add social login providers (Google, GitHub, etc.)
3. Create user profile page to view match history
4. Add email verification reminder for unconfirmed users
5. Implement proper error tracking/monitoring

## Security Notes
- Passwords are handled by Supabase (bcrypt hashed)
- Session tokens are httpOnly cookies
- RLS policies ensure data isolation
- All user operations require authentication
